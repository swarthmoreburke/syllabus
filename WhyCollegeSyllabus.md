This writing-intensive first-year seminar asks why we go to college - as individuals and as social groups. Why does college matter, and to whom? Drawing on evidence including memoirs, fiction, opinion essays, demographic data, sociological writing, course catalogs and syllabi, and much more, we will example how access and financial aid, curricular decisions, diversity, inequality, governance, and knowledge production play out in the context of liberal arts education.

### Course Objectives

We have designed this course to help first-year students connect their own experiences with and aspirations for college to long-running conversations and debates about the nature and purpose of higher education. Students will learn to understand the histories that have shaped their current experiences, and to critically interpret controversies and questions surrounding academic institutions. They will be asked to apply their learning experiences to inform and shape the ongoing work of the Aydelotte Foundation in pursuit of these same questions and concerns.

Students will learn to draw upon the shared and divergent methodologies of literary study, history and adjacent disciplines in shaping and revising their written work in the class. We will not just teach techniques and approaches to the interpretation of class materials, but also competing and complementary ideas about the purpose of interpretation. This seminar is intended not only to contrast and compare two disciplinary modes of understanding, but to provide a road map to other disciplinary approaches that might be fruitful.

We also aim teach students to compose effective arguments and write compelling prose across multiple genres of writing commonly found in public writing about higher education. We will teach students to write alone, to workshop individually-authored writing with peers, to receive and integrate feedback from instructors, and to write and revise multi-authored pieces. The course includes twenty pages of writing with significant required revisions, in-classroom writing instruction, in-class peer workshops, and individual and collective conferences with instructors. Writing in this course emphasizes both individual and collaborative modes of composition and revision.


### Course Format

Most days we will roughly divide our meeting into three sections. During our first hour, we will lecture (with some opportunities for questions and discussion); during the second hour, we will convene in two smaller discussion groups, each led by one professor. We will dedicate our third hour to writing (and revising our writing) about the things we are talking about - as individuals and in groups.

### Policies, Platforms, and Advice

#### Books
The main books you will need to buy are:
+ Tressie McMillan Cottom, Lower Ed
+ Richard Powers, Galetea 2.2
+ Richard Rodriguez, The Hunger of Memory
+ Zadie Smith, On Beauty
+ Lev Grossman, The Magicians

The books are available at the bookstore. You are also welcome to buy the books online or at a different store. Be aware that you need to have your own copy of the specific edition of each of the books listed above. All other texts will be available on Dropbox unless otherwise specified. Please print out, read, mark up, and bring to class ALL of the texts assigned as required reading for each week (this subject to modification in class).

If you are curious about what *we* have read in order to give our weekly lectures, you will find a partial list of background readings for each week’s lectures in the Why College folder of the (in-progress) Aydelotte Foundation Zotero bibliography:

https://www.zotero.org/groups/1720498/aydelotte_bibliography/items/collectionKey/5L6V5W8C

#### CMS
We will not use a Course Management System (CMS) like Moodle in this class. Instead, we will use Dropbox to share readings and final drafts of writing and Google Docs on Google Drive for other drafts of writing. We will keep the most up to date version of our course syllabus on Github. We will discuss in class why we have made these imperfect choices, and how we might have chosen differently.

#### Mastodon
We will use our Twitter-like, Swarthmore-hosted Mastodon accounts for sharing weekly questions, posts, and links. Sign up for an account here: https://mastodon.fishtank.swarthmore.edu/web/getting-started

#### Grading
We will be evaluating your attentiveness during lecture, your participation in second-hour discussions, and your work in third-hour writing workshops in addition to the large body individual, paired, and collective writing you will do over the course of the semester.

#### Accommodations for disability
We want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn most effectively. You are always free to talk to us about your own situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here:
> If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, please contact Student Disability Services (Parrish 113W, 123W) via e-mail at studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, the office will issue students with documented disabilities or medical conditions a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible.  For details about the accommodations process, visit the Student Disability Services website. You are also welcome to contact me [the faculty member] privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.

#### Dean's Discretionary Fund and Dean's Office resources for basic needs
If purchasing your textbooks or other materials for this or any other class present a serious financial difficulty for you, you should be aware of the [Dean's Discretionary Fund](http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-life/deans-discretionary-funding-request-guidelines) and other resources such as the Course Book Collection in Underhill Library in Lang Music.

The Dean's Office describes the fund  this way:

> The spirit of this funding is primarily to support emergency circumstances and priority is given to students in the highest financial need tiers.  Funding is usually limited to under $500 and most grants are under $300.  Please note the Dean's Office may not be able to fulfill all requests.

> Examples of eligible non-academic requests include, but are not limited to, expenses associated with emergency medical, dental, vision procedures, unanticipated trips home due to a family emergency, and various fees related to postgraduate opportunities.

The Student Life office at Swarthmore is very committed to making sure that all students having living situations that support their ability to work and live here successfully. If you find that you are having sustained difficulties with your food or housing situation and believe that this may affect your course performance, you should contact your class dean; you are also free to contact me if you wish so that I can help you find the support you need.

#### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. If you have any questions about how to properly cite another person’s work, please do not hesitate to ask me.

#### Attendance and due dates
Because this is a seminar, attendance is essential. Missing seminar (except for cases of illness or true emergencies) is inadvisable. However, if you are really ill, try to contact me ahead of time, but do plan to miss class! *Again, because this is a seminar involving in-class workshops, deadlines for writing is firm, firm, firm.* Plan ahead.

#### Devices Policy
We will sometimes use laptops, primarily in the third hour when we are workshopping writing. Please keep your laptops closed at other times unless you are using a laptop as part of an accommodation. If you have not already, please a fill out our laptop survey.
